Hello! I just wanted to make a little cat animation for fun. I saw a bee wake my cat up, my cat took one swing at it and fell asleep. I thought it would be a good opportunity to practice Linux system calls, so I worked with POSIX systems C to create a program that uses ASCII art (in txt files) to make an animation. I used Nanosleep to create times between frames, and I just used write to send the output to the terminal.

I edited ASCII art made by Blazej Kozlowski to make a cat wake up during a nap to swing at a bee.
