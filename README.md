Hello! I just wanted to make a little cat animation for fun. 
I saw my cat get woken up by a bee, take one swing at it, and fall asleep. 
I thought it would be a good opportunity to practice Linux system calls, so I worked with POSIX systems C to create an animation. 
I used Nanosleep to create times between frames, and I just used write to send the output to the terminal.
